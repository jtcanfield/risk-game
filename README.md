# Description
I had the properly crazy idea to create the game of risk, graphically, in vanilla js.
So, here I go!

Trello:

note: in the code, the players are objects in an array, and all game pieces are objects in an array.
the ai works on "value" numbers to determine where to attack, reinforce, and how to act.
